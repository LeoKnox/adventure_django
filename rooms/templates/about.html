    <h1>About this site</h1>
    <p>
        Web site built using python, django and sqlite. When creating this site. I wanted
        to create crud interface using Django. First I set up a model for basic room with 
        basic description for room and door. I used a many-to-many relationship for the 
        room and doors. I also set up 'Choices' for the room. I set up to add doors to the
        room using checkboxes to take advantage of the many-to-many relationship.
    </p>
    <p>
        After I set this up. I added additional fields to the room and door. I added 
        locations to the door model. This way I could position door in the room. Then
        when editing the room. I added a list of available doors if user wanted to add
        another after creation. I then filtered the list of doors to exclude the room
        itself, I do not at this point want doors leading back to the same room. And
        removed duplicate doors so you could have multiple doors going to same room.
    </p>
    <p>
        I added a new model for treasure to be added to rooms. I set it up as a one-
        to-many realationship. This is because I did want to have a room with more
        than one of the same type of treasure. Added a sort feature so it shows treasure
        by room not just listed in order.
    </p>
    <p>
        Then I added validation for forms. Compare entered value to room's values so door location
        cannot exceed the width of the wall. &#x2611; Added validation so two doors cannot be 
        located in the same space. &#x2611;
    </p>
    <p>
        Use check boxes to add multiple items to many to many field at the same time. &#x2611;
    </p>
    <h1>New options</h1>
    <p>

    <p>
        Added visual representation of the room. Using arithmatic
        operations on django variables to create room size and 
        place doors both on wall and location on wall. &#x2611;
    </p>
