    <h1>About this site</h1>
    <p>
        Web site built using python, django and sqlite. Made to build interconnecting
        rooms. Rooms are connected by a many to many relationship. Features I have used
        and learned.
    </p>
    <p>
        I used a choices option and read choices from within models. I
        searched rooms and doors to add to room using checkboxes. Filters room
        checkboxes so the door does cannot go back to itself. Or have two
        door leading to the same room(This feature might be changed but was
        good exercise to implement).
    </p>
    <p>
        Set up validation for forms. Compare entered value to room's values so door location
        cannot exceed the width of the wall. &#x2611;
    </p>
    <p>
        Use check boxes to add multiple items to many to many field at the same time. &#x2611;
    </p>
    <h1>New options</h1>
    <p>
        Change door edit. Add door then add locations. &#x2611;
    </p>
    <p>
        More options to rooms and doors. Added treasure to rooms. Allows treasure to be edited.

        Location of doors. &#x2611;
    </p>
    <p>

    <p>
        Added visual representation of the room. Using arithmatic
        operations on django variables to create room size and 
        place doors both on wall and location on wall. &#x2611;
    </p>
    <p>
        Find way to break up edit room. Since everything seems to
        be on that page.
